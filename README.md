# local_rag_ai_agent_csv
This Python project builds a local AI agent that answers questions about a pizza restaurant using customer reviews from CSV or text files. It uses LangChain for prompt/model chaining, Ollama for local LLM inference, and Chroma for vector search, providing interactive, review-based responses to user queries.
